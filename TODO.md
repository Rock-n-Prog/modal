# TODOs

Yep, I don't have a project board yet.

## Config

- Review package.json
- Review tsconfig.json
- How do we use pnpm properly here? Maybe turborepo? Would help with linting examples.
  - Examples are ignored in .eslintignore at the moment
- Add build workflow
- Add publish workflow

## Docs

- Add CONTRIBUTING.md

## Examples

- CSS
- styled-components
- SCSS modules
